# Mikrobus-Cobbler
The idea is that to prototype you plug the cobbler into a breadboard and connect via a ribbon cable to the Raspberry Pi. (With the new Raspberry Pi zero being shipped without a header pre soldered, it is possible to solder a connector to the bottom of the Pi Zero and avoid the ribbon cable. Note the Pi zero only costs $5.00 so its not expensive to use in this dedicated way.)

Note my original attempt had an island rectangle hole in the PCB but the Fab I use could not cope with that so I had to use drill holes to allow access to the underlying breadboard.

Having prototyped using the cobbler and a breadboard, hobbyists and students can make a more permanent prototype using an Alternative Mikrobus Prototype Board see https://github.com/KeithSloan/Mikrobus-Proto

Note pupils and hobbyists don't often have access to PCB making facilities, hence the provision of a general purpose board.
